## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Development
###This is my first project, and I hope I managed to use all I learned in good way

1. I have added the sections via JavaScript.

2. I created a function to create a link for each section.

3. I used a custom data type (data-) to link it the the code that inserts sections at navagition bar and with the scrolling function to keep it conistant and logical.

4. I Modified the active class properties for both section and link.

5.I made scrolling function to scroll screen smoothly when clicked on only sections at navigation bar.

6. I replaced the html code of the sections with for loop in javascript.

7. I made a button to create additional Sections.

8. I made an icon to go to the top of the page.
